# Instructions

In this lesson, you will create a webpage that allows users
to find a pokemon by their name. You will make GET requests
to [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). If you are ever lost on
how to format your requests or how to access certain values
out of the API's response, look at the site for guidance.


The 'index.html' file includes an input field and a
button. The user will type in the name of a Pokemon into
the input field and then click the button. You should
make an API call to the above link and show the `name`, `type`, and
the `front_default` sprite for that species of Pokemon.
If the result of the API request is `NULL`, no Pokemon
was found, and you should show an error message on screen.
